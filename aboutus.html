                <p>
                    The story of the Philippine Red Cross is the story of men and women from all walks 
                    of life who have dedicated themselves to the service of humanity. It is the tale of

                    the poorest of the poor. Professionally trained and truly compassionate, these men and 
                    women are ready to lend a helping hand to those in need â€“ whoever, whenever and wherever 
                    they may be.
